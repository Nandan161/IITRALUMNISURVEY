# IITRALUMNISURVEY
# 📊 IITRAA Youth Participation Analysis & Recommendations

## 🔍 Project Summary

This project analyzes survey data from IIT Roorkee alumni (graduating between 2010–2024) to uncover trends in membership and participation in IITRAA (IIT Roorkee Alumni Association). Using Python for data cleaning, analysis, and visualization, we identify key engagement gaps and provide actionable recommendations to boost involvement of younger alumni.

## 📌 Objectives

- Analyze alumni awareness and membership trends
- Identify barriers to participation across years and regions
- Understand preferred event formats and communication platforms
- Generate data-driven recommendations for IITRAA Central & Chapters

## 📊 Highlights from Analysis

- 📉 **Lowest membership** among 2020–21 batches (COVID-era)
- 📡 **Lack of awareness** cited as the top reason for non-membership
- 💬 **Preferred engagement**: Networking, Career Support, Reunions
- 📍 **Regional gaps** in membership seen in NCR, Pune, Chennai

---

## 📈 Visualizations

The project includes:

- Year-wise and batch-wise membership trend plots
- Heatmaps and bar graphs for participation preferences
- Region-based distribution of responses
- Word clouds from open-ended alumni suggestions

> All visualizations are saved in the `/output` folder and also rendered inline in the Jupyter notebooks.

## 🤖 Recommendations (Generated & Visualized via Python)

Using the insights from the data, we developed strategic recommendations for:

- **IITRAA Central Body**: Central database, campus engagement, event calendar
- **Chapters**: Regular hybrid events, budget-friendly meetups, onboarding support

Each recommendation is supported by visual trends and data evidence.
